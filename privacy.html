MAINTAIN-IT PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: December 2025

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INTRODUCTION

Maintain-It ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application Maintain-It (the "App").

The fundamental principle of Maintain-It is simple: Your data belongs to you, and we don't want it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY PRIVACY HIGHLIGHTS

• We DO NOT collect your personal information
• We DO NOT store your data on external servers
• We DO NOT track your usage or behavior
• We DO NOT sell or share your information
• We DO NOT have access to your maintenance records
• All data stays on YOUR device

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT

We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:

• Personal identifying information (name, email, address, phone number)
• Location data (beyond initial region detection for seasonal tasks)
• Maintenance records or service history
• Vehicle or property information you enter
• Photos you attach to service records
• Financial information or payment details
• Usage analytics or behavioral data
• Contact lists or address books
• Any personally identifiable information (PII)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INFORMATION STORED LOCALLY ON YOUR DEVICE

The following information is stored ONLY on your device:

Vehicle & Property Information:
• Vehicle make, model, year, mileage
• Property type, age, features
• Custom names and descriptions you create

Maintenance Data:
• Tasks you create or modify
• Service completion dates and costs
• Notes and observations you add
• Photos you attach to service records

Settings & Preferences:
• Regional preferences (USA, Europe, Australia, etc.)
• Unit preferences (miles/km, °F/°C)
• Notification settings
• Theme preferences (light/dark mode)

Warranty Information (Pro users):
• Warranty documents you scan or upload
• Product information you enter
• Expiration dates and coverage details

This data remains on your device and is backed up to your personal iCloud account if you have iCloud backup enabled in iOS Settings.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Since we don't collect your information, we don't use it.

All processing of your maintenance data happens locally on your device:
• Calculating due dates for maintenance tasks
• Generating maintenance schedules
• Creating notifications and reminders
• Producing service history reports (Pro)
• Processing VIN barcodes (Pro)
• Extracting warranty information via AI (Pro)

None of this data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ICLOUD BACKUP

If you enable iCloud backup on your device (iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Backup), your Maintain-It data will be backed up to your personal iCloud account managed by Apple.

Important notes about iCloud:
• This is YOUR iCloud account, not ours
• We have zero access to your iCloud data
• Backup is controlled by you through iOS Settings
• Data transfers between your devices via your iCloud account
• Apple's Privacy Policy governs iCloud data: apple.com/legal/privacy

We recommend enabling iCloud backup to protect your data in case you lose your device or get a new one.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

RevenueCat (Subscription Management):
We use RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect:
• Anonymous subscription status (active, expired, trial)
• Purchase receipts (handled by Apple)
• Device identifiers for subscription validation

RevenueCat does NOT receive:
• Your maintenance data
• Personal information beyond what Apple provides for purchases
• Any usage data from within the app

RevenueCat Privacy Policy: revenuecat.com/privacy

Apple App Store:
When you download the app or make in-app purchases, Apple collects information according to their privacy policy:
• Apple ID and account information
• Payment information (handled entirely by Apple)
• Download and purchase history

Apple Privacy Policy: apple.com/legal/privacy

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LOCATION SERVICES

Maintain-It uses location services in very limited ways:

Region Detection (One-Time):
On first launch, the app may request your approximate location to:
• Detect if you're in Northern or Southern Hemisphere
• Pre-select appropriate regional settings (USA, Europe, Australia, etc.)
• Provide climate-appropriate seasonal maintenance tasks

This detection happens once and:
• Uses coarse location only (city-level, not precise coordinates)
• Can be declined - you can manually select your region instead
• Location data is NOT stored or transmitted
• After initial detection, location services are not used again

GPS Mileage Tracking (Optional - Pro Feature):
For vehicles with model year 2015 or newer, you can enable automatic mileage tracking:
• Uses GPS to track driving distance
• Calculations happen entirely on your device
• Location coordinates are NOT stored
• Only the calculated mileage is saved locally
• You can disable this and use manual mileage entry instead

You control all location permissions in iOS Settings → Maintain-It → Location.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAMERA ACCESS

Maintain-It requests camera access for:

• VIN barcode scanning (Pro)
• Taking photos of service receipts
• Photographing warranty documents (Pro)
• Capturing before/after maintenance photos

Camera access:
• Only used when you actively choose to scan or take photos
• Photos are stored locally on your device only
• No photos are uploaded to external servers
• You can deny camera access and manually enter information instead

Control camera permissions in iOS Settings → Maintain-It → Camera.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NOTIFICATIONS

The app sends local notifications to remind you of upcoming maintenance:

• Notifications are generated on your device
• No data is sent to external servers to create notifications
• Notification preferences are stored locally
• You control all notifications in iOS Settings → Maintain-It → Notifications

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING

By default, Maintain-It does NOT collect analytics or crash reports.

Optional Analytics (Opt-In Only):
You may choose to enable anonymous analytics in Settings → Privacy → Analytics. If enabled, we may collect:
• App performance metrics (load times, memory usage)
• Feature usage statistics (which screens are viewed - no personal data)
• Crash reports (diagnostic information only)

Even when enabled:
• All analytics are anonymous and cannot be linked to you
• No personal information or maintenance data is included
• No usage patterns that could identify you
• You can disable anytime in app settings

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DATA RETENTION

Since we don't collect your data, we don't retain it.

Data on your device:
• Free plan: 90-day service history retention
• Pro plan: Unlimited history retention
• You can delete data anytime in Settings → Danger Zone → Reset All Data

Data deletion:
• Deleting the app removes all local data
• If iCloud backup is enabled, data may remain in your iCloud for backup purposes
• You control iCloud data through iOS Settings

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DATA SECURITY

We protect your data through:

Local Storage:
• All data stored on your device using iOS secure storage
• Protected by your device passcode/biometric authentication
• Encrypted when your device is locked (iOS security)

No Server Exposure:
• Since data never leaves your device, there's no risk of server breaches
• No accounts or passwords to be compromised
• No central database to be hacked

Your Responsibility:
• Protect your device with a strong passcode
• Enable iCloud backup to prevent data loss
• Keep your iOS updated for latest security patches

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Maintain-It is not directed to children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information from anyone, we inherently don't collect from children.

If you believe a child under 13 has provided information through the app, please contact us at maintainit.help@hotmail.com so we can assist.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Your data does not leave your device, so there are no international data transfers.

The only exception is if you enable iCloud backup - in that case, Apple may store your data in various regions according to their policies. See Apple's privacy policy for details on how they handle international data transfers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR RIGHTS

You have complete control over your data:

Access:
• All your data is accessible within the app at all times
• View service history, tasks, vehicles, properties anytime

Modification:
• Edit or update any information in the app
• Change settings and preferences anytime

Deletion:
• Delete individual records, tasks, or entire vehicles/properties
• Complete app reset in Settings → Danger Zone
• Uninstall the app to remove all local data

Export (Pro):
• Export all your data as PDF or CSV files

• Decline location permissions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights.

However, since Maintain-It:
• Does not collect personal information
• Does not sell personal information
• Does not share personal information with third parties
• Stores all data locally on your device

The CCPA's main provisions do not apply as there is no personal information being collected, sold, or shared.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EUROPEAN UNION PRIVACY RIGHTS (GDPR)

If you are in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with specific rights.

• No personal data is collected (Art. 6 - Lawful basis not needed)
• No personal data is processed on servers (Art. 5 - Data minimization)
• No data transfers outside EU (Art. 44 - Transfer mechanisms not needed)
• No data retention by us (Art. 5 - Storage limitation)

Your GDPR rights:
• Right to access: All data is in the app
• Right to rectification: Edit anytime in the app
• Right to erasure: Delete data in Settings or uninstall app
